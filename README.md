<summary>Explanation of Required Environment Variables for Discord OAuth2 and Bot Authentication</summary>
<br/>

These are environment variables that you need to set in order to use Discord's OAuth2 API and to authenticate your bot with Discord.

- `DATABASE_URL:` This is the URL for your database. You need to replace it with the actual URL for your database.

- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET:` This is a secret key used by NextAuth.js for secure session cookies and CSRF protection. You should generate a new secret key and replace it with the placeholder.

- `NEXTAUTH_URL:` This is the URL for your application. Replace it with the actual URL where your application will be hosted.
- DISCORD_CLIENT_ID: This is the client ID of your Discord application. You can get it from the Discord Developer Portal.

- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET:` This is the client secret of your Discord application. You can get it from the Discord Developer Portal.

- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN:` This is the bot token for your Discord bot. You need to create a bot in the Discord Developer Portal and get the token from there.

- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: This is the webhook URL for your Discord server. You can create a webhook in your server settings and get the URL from there.

3. Under the "Connection" tab, copy the Connection string (URI).
4. In your project, create a .env.local file at the root of the project folder.
5. In the .env.local file, set the DATABASE_URL variable to your Supabase connection string URI.
